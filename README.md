Uploading work to GitHub using VS Code was a challenging but valuable learning experience. One of the biggest challenges I faced was dealing with Git errors when trying to push my files to the repository. Sometimes, authentication issues would pop up, especially when trying to connect my local project to the remote GitHub repository. Other times, I ran into merge conflicts or error messages that I didn't fully understand at first.

To solve these issues, I had to do a lot of troubleshooting. I looked up error messages online, read through GitHub and VS Code documentation, and even watched tutorial videos to better understand the Git workflow. Learning how to use the terminal effectively within VS Code helped a lot. I also started using Git commands like git status, git add, git commit, and git push more confidently after some practice. Eventually, I was able to upload my work successfully.

Looking ahead, I would improve my portfolio by organizing my files better and making sure each project has a clear README file explaining what it is and how it works. I also want to learn more about Git branches so I can work on updates without affecting the main project. Overall, despite the difficulties, the experience helped me grow my technical skills and confidence.
